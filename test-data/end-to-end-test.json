Google Calendar and Outlook integration for deadline syncing\n2. File attachments on tasks (up to 10MB per file)\n3. Task templates for recurring workflows\n4. Bulk task operations (edit, delete, move)\n5. Advanced filtering and sorting options\n\nMedium Priority:\n1. Time tracking with billable hours\n2. Commenting system on tasks\n3. Task dependencies and subtasks\n4. Custom project templates\n5. Email notifications\n\nLow Priority:\n1. API access for third-party integrations\n2. Export functionality (PDF, CSV)\n3. Mobile app (future phase)\n4. Advanced analytics and reporting\n\nPlease factor these into your architecture planning and user story creation.\n\nRegards,\nStakeholder"
