# Dependency Resolution Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
GitHub Actions started failing with npm dependency conflicts:
```
npm error While resolving: @testing-library/react@16.1.0
npm error Found: react@18.3.1
npm error peer react@"^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0-rc" from @testing-library/react@16.1.0
```

## Root Cause
1. **NOT a code generation bug** - Previous runs worked fine
2. **npm version resolution issue** - Without `package-lock.json`, npm resolves `^14.2.1` to the latest major version
3. **Recent package release** - @testing-library/react v16 was recently released for React 19
4. **Caret ranges** - Using `^14.2.1` allowed npm to jump to v16

## Timeline
- **Run 17268817949** (successful) - Before v16 was widely available
- **Run 17269565447** (failed) - npm resolved to incompatible v16

## Solution Applied

### Changed from Caret Ranges to Exact Versions
Updated both generators to use exact versions without caret (^):

**Before:**
```json
"@testing-library/react": "^14.2.1",
"@testing-library/user-event": "^14.5.2"
```

**After:**
```json
"@testing-library/react": "14.2.1",
"@testing-library/user-event": "14.5.2"
```

### Files Modified
1. `/lambdas/core/story-executor/templates/react_fullstack_generator.py`
2. `/lambdas/core/story-executor/templates/react_spa_generator.py`

### Lambda Deployed
✅ Story Executor Lambda deployed with exact versions at 2025-08-27

## Why This Fix Works
- **Exact versions** prevent npm from resolving to incompatible major versions
- **No more surprises** when new packages are released
- **Consistent builds** even without package-lock.json

## Testing Library Compatibility Matrix
| React Version | Testing Library Version | Status |
|--------------|------------------------|---------|
| React 18.x   | @testing-library/react 14.x | ✅ Compatible |
| React 18.x   | @testing-library/react 16.x | ❌ Incompatible |
| React 19.x   | @testing-library/react 16.x | ✅ Compatible |

## Future Improvements
1. Consider generating `package-lock.json` files for truly reproducible builds
2. Add validation to ensure React and Testing Library versions are compatible
3. Use npm shrinkwrap for production deployments

## Immediate Impact
New projects generated will use exact versions and won't have this dependency conflict issue.
